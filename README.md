# Word-Guess-Game
Week 3 Homework Due Oct 20th

Started on The Word Game, spend quite a long time on it. Switched over to The Psychic Game to make sure I could have a finished assignment to turn in on time.

Was stuck quite awhile on The Psychic Game, especially not realizing where I declared my variables was affecting my code. What especially got me stuck was to set the computer's letter on page load...Didn't realize I had to do that. At least for the way I had the rest of my code written.

Still having a hard time with Git. Wondering if it has something to do with OneDrive.  It would be really nice to save my changes in get up as I go along. I have really learned the value in that.
